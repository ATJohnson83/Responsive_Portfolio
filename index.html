			<h1>About Me</h1>
			
			<img class="ATJ_pic" src="assets/images/ATJ_JMVQ_NY.jpg" alt="Jason Marsalis Quartet w/ Austin Johnson on piano">
			
			<p>I am a Jazz Pianist and aspiring web developer. I recently moved back to Raleigh, NC, where I grew up, from New Orleans, LA, where I lived and worked as Musician for the past 8 years.  In addition to freelancing, I have been touring internationally with the Jason Marsalis Quartet since 2007.</p>

	    <p>After many years making a living as a musician I became interested in Web Development.  My longterm goal is to have a career as a webdeveloper that allows me the flexibility to still be active as a musician, but in a more selective capacity.  I currently work in the office of the Whitman Masonry Company during the day, and am studying Web Development at night and on the weekends at the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp.
